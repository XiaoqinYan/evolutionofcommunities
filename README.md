# evolution of social communities: an agent-based approach
Notice some tips:
1. All vote_number and vote_number_name files are data for congresses 101-110. It is separated across congresses and sessions. For example, vote_109_1 is has votes from 1st session of the 109th congress. For each bill, there are two lines in the file: 1st line is the bill number and date, 2nd line has 100 characters Y, N, -. File vote_109_1_names has one line per bill, containing names of senators, party and state. They are ordered according to votes in the vote_109_1 file. Sometimes it happens that senators change between 1st session and 2nd session, so votes in column, say, 23 do not always correspond to one senator. Therefore names file should be referenced.
